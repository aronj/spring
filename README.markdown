### Compiling

Detailed instructions for how to compile Spring can be found [here](http://springrts.com/wiki/Building_spring)

The most simple set of commands will be:

### Installation

Usually, you want to use an installer or a package prepared for your OS:

* Windows: <http://springrts.com/wiki/Download>
* Linux:   <http://springrts.com/wiki/SetupGuide>

If you want to compile and install from source, please see [this wiki page](http://springrts.com/wiki/Building_spring)

### Using

Use a lobby client for playing single- or multi-player matches.
A list of lobbies may be found [here](http://springrts.com/wiki/Lobby_Development#Lobby_client_development)

Once you are in-game, Spring games basically work like every other RTS,
though it has [a LOT of additional ways of control and customizability](http://springrts.com/wiki/Using_Spring).
